# Getting Started with PipeWire

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

[PipeWire](https://pipewire.org) is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia pipelines.It provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine on top of audio and video devices that can be used to support the use cases currently handled by both pulseaudio and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from containerized applications easy. Nodes in the graph can be implemented as separate processes, communicating with sockets and exchanging multimedia content using fd passing. PipeWire was created by [Wim Taymans](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wtaymans), Principal Engineer at Red Hat and co-creator of the GStreamer multimedia framework.
 
 **Key features of PipeWire include:**
 
   - Capture and playback of audio and video with minimal latency.
   - Real-time Multimedia processing on audio and video.
   - Multiprocess architecture to let applications share multimedia content.
   - Seamless support for PulseAudio, JACK, ALSA and GStreamer applications.

How WirePlumber, the PipeWire session manager works. Source: [Collabora](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2020/05/07/wireplumber-the-pipewire-session-manager/)

## PipeWire Tools

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

[WirePlumber](https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/) is a modular session / policy manager for [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/) and a GObject-based high-level library that wraps PipeWire’s API, providing convenience for writing the daemon’s modules as well as external tools for managing PipeWire. The WirePlumber daemon implements the session & policy management service. It follows a modular design, having plugins that implement the actual management functionality.

[Core API](https://docs.pipewire.org/group__api__pw__core.html) is used by all clients that need to communicate with the [PipeWire Daemon](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_daemon.html) and provides the necessary structs to interface with the daemon.

[Implementation API](https://docs.pipewire.org/group__api__pw__impl.html) is primarily used by the [PipeWire Daemon](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_daemon.html) itself but also by the [PipeWire Session Manager](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_session_manager.html) and modules/extensions that need to build objects in the graph.

[SPA (Simple Plugin API)](https://docs.pipewire.org/group__api__spa.html) is an extensible API to implement all kinds of plugins.

[PipeWire-rs](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire-rs) is a Rust bindings for pipewire and SPA libraries.

  <br />
</p>

**Note:** PipeWire is default in Debian 12 and Linux Mint Dedbian Edition 6. The instructions below are for those still using [Debian 10 and Debian 11](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS).

* [PipeWire - Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/PipeWire)
* [Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS)

Before you begin make sure to cd ```/etc/apt/sources.list.d``` in the terminal.

### Install PipeWire

```sudo apt install pipewire```

**Create this empty file:**

```# touch /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/with-pulseaudio```

Create a pipewire-pulse service by copying the example files:

```# cp /usr/share/doc/pipewire/examples/systemd/user/pipewire-pulse.* /etc/systemd/user/```

#### Run these three commands as your regular user (not as root):

**Check for new service files with:**

```systemctl --user daemon-reload```

**Disable and stop the PulseAudio service with:**

```systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket```

**Enable and start the new pipewire-pulse service with:**

```systemctl --user --now enable pipewire pipewire-pulse```

**This will configure PipeWire to activate its PulseAudio replacement daemon. Verify that it's enabled by running:**

```LANG=C pactl info | grep '^Server Name'```

It should say **Server Name: PulseAudio (on PipeWire 0.3.19)**.

**To ensure this continues working after a reboot. You will need to "mask" the PulseAudio service by running:**

```systemctl --user mask pulseaudio```

## Wayland Learning Resources

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

[Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an [X application](https://www.x.org/wiki/XServer/), or a wayland client itself.

## Wayland Tools

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

[Weston](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston) is a lightweight and functional Wayland compositor.

[XWayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html) is an X Server running as a Wayland client(for backwards compatibility), allowing the [Xorg server](https://www.x.org/wiki/XServer/) can be modified to use wayland input devices for input and forward either the root window or individual top-level windows as wayland surfaces.

[KWin](https://community.kde.org/KWin/Wayland) is the window manager for the KDE Plasma Desktop. It gives you complete control over your windows, making sure they're not in the way but aid you in your task. It paints the window decoration, the bar on top of every window with (configurable) buttons like close, maximize and minimize.

[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) is the faster, smarter way to create innovative devices, modern UIs & applications for multiple screens. It is one of the most popular toolkits for the Wayland and X11 windowing.

[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) is a free and open source cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces developed by [GNOME Project](https://www.gnome.org/). It is one of the most popular toolkits for the Wayland and X11 windowing.

[NVIDIA Wayland EGL External Platform library](https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland) is a work-in-progress implementation of a EGL External Platform library to add client-side Wayland support to EGL on top of EGLDevice and EGLStream families of extensions.

[NVIDIA EGL External Platform Interface](https://github.com/NVIDIA/eglexternalplatform) is a work-in-progress specification of the EGL External Platform interface for writing EGL platforms and their interactions with modern window systems on top of existing low-level EGL platform implementations. This keeps window system implementation specifics out of EGL drivers by using application-facing EGL functions.

[Sway](https://swaywm.org/) is an [i3](https://i3wm.org/)-compatible Wayland compositor.

[wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots) is a modular Wayland compositor library.

[WayfireWM](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire) is a 3D Wayland compositor, inspired by [Compiz](https://launchpad.net/compiz) and based on [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots).

[SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm) is a modern display manager for X11 and Wayland aiming to be fast, simple and beautiful. It uses modern technologies like QtQuick, which in turn gives the designer the ability to create smooth, animated user interfaces.

[x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker) is an application that you allows to run graphical desktop applications (and entire desktops) in Docker Linux containers.

[Mako](https://github.com/emersion/mako) is alightweight notification daemon for Wayland. It also works on [Sway](https://swaywm.org/).

[Wayland-rs](https://github.com/Smithay/wayland-rs) is a Rust implementation of the wayland protocol (client and server).

[Wine-wayland](https://github.com/varmd/wine-wayland) is an application that allows you to running DX9/DX11 and Vulkan games using pure Wayland and Wine/DXVK.
